NB: [Difference between print and puts](<https://flexiple.com/puts-vs-p-vs-print-ruby/#:~:text=One%20major%20difference%20between%20print,while%20using%20the%20print%20method.&text=In%20puts%20method%2C%20the%20newline%20is%20automatically%20appended.>): ###
 
Print does not append a newline automatically. Newlines must be manually added while using the print method

On the other hand, puts creates a new line after the string.
